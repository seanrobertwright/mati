# ðŸš¨ REAL ISSUE: Corporate Firewall Blocking Supabase

## Problem Identified

Your **corporate network (Cisco Umbrella)** is **BLOCKING** access to:
- `vwwcprauksknefwslips.supabase.co`
- Being redirected to `malware.opendns.com`

**This is NOT a code issue** - it's network security blocking Supabase domains.

## Evidence

```
Server: Cisco Umbrella
Response: Redirect to malware.opendns.com
Status: 403 Forbidden
```

Cisco Umbrella is a cloud-based security service that filters DNS and blocks certain domains.

## Solutions

### **Option 1: Whitelist Supabase (Best for Company Use)**

Contact your IT department to whitelist:
- `*.supabase.co`
- `supabase.com`

Explain it's a legitimate database-as-a-service platform used for development.

### **Option 2: Use VPN (Quick Workaround)**

Connect to a VPN that bypasses corporate filtering:
- Personal VPN service
- Cloud provider VPN
- Or use your home network via VPN

### **Option 3: Mobile Hotspot (Temporary Testing)**

Connect your laptop to:
- Your phone's mobile hotspot
- Different WiFi network
- Home network (not corporate)

### **Option 4: Use Local Supabase (Development Alternative)**

Run Supabase locally - no internet required:

```bash
# Install Supabase CLI
npm install -g supabase

# Start local Supabase
supabase start

# Will show local credentials like:
# API URL: http://localhost:54321
# Anon key: eyJhbGc...

# Update .env.local:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:54321
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<anon-key-from-output>
```

This runs a local PostgreSQL + Auth server, no external connection needed.

### **Option 5: Use Alternative Backend (Long-term)**

Switch from Supabase to:
- **Local PostgreSQL** only (no Supabase Auth)
- **Firebase** (if not blocked)
- **AWS Cognito** (if not blocked)
- **NextAuth.js** with local database

## Quick Test

To confirm this is the issue, try from a different network:
```bash
# From your phone hotspot or home network
npm run dev
# Try signup - it should work
```

## Recommended Path Forward

**For Corporate Environment:**
1. Request IT to whitelist `*.supabase.co`
2. While waiting, use **Option 4: Local Supabase** for development

**Local Supabase Setup:**
```bash
# 1. Install CLI
npm install -g supabase

# 2. Initialize project
supabase init

# 3. Start local services
supabase start

# 4. Copy the local API URL and anon key to .env.local

# 5. Run migrations
supabase db push

# 6. Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

## Why This Happened

- Corporate networks use DNS filtering (Cisco Umbrella, OpenDNS)
- Supabase domains might be blocked due to:
  - Cloud database services category
  - Security policy blocking external databases
  - General cloud service restrictions

## Verify Which Network Is Blocking

```powershell
# Test from different networks
# Corporate WiFi â†’ Should fail
# Mobile hotspot â†’ Should work
# Home network â†’ Should work
```

---

**TL;DR:** Your corporate firewall is blocking Supabase. Use mobile hotspot to test, or install local Supabase for development.

Would you like help setting up **local Supabase** so you can develop without network restrictions?
