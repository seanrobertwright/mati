## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Supabase Connection Configuration
The system SHALL provide a secure and configurable connection to a Supabase PostgreSQL database using environment variables.

#### Scenario: Successful database connection
- **WHEN** the application starts with valid Supabase credentials in environment variables
- **THEN** a connection pool is established to the PostgreSQL database
- **AND** the connection is available for queries

#### Scenario: Missing environment variables
- **WHEN** required Supabase environment variables are not provided
- **THEN** the application SHALL fail to start with a clear error message
- **AND** the error message SHALL indicate which variables are missing

#### Scenario: Invalid database credentials
- **WHEN** environment variables contain invalid Supabase credentials
- **THEN** database queries SHALL fail with connection error
- **AND** error messages SHALL be logged to the server console

### Requirement: Drizzle ORM Integration
The system SHALL use Drizzle ORM as the database abstraction layer for type-safe database operations.

#### Scenario: Type-safe queries
- **WHEN** a database query is written using Drizzle ORM
- **THEN** TypeScript SHALL provide full type inference from the schema
- **AND** compile-time validation SHALL catch type errors

#### Scenario: Query execution
- **WHEN** a Drizzle query is executed
- **THEN** the query SHALL be translated to optimized SQL
- **AND** results SHALL be returned with proper TypeScript types

### Requirement: Connection Pooling
The system SHALL implement connection pooling to efficiently manage database connections.

#### Scenario: Multiple concurrent requests
- **WHEN** multiple components query the database simultaneously
- **THEN** connections SHALL be reused from the pool
- **AND** no connection limits SHALL be exceeded

#### Scenario: Idle connection cleanup
- **WHEN** database connections are idle beyond the configured timeout
- **THEN** connections SHALL be released back to the pool
- **AND** resources SHALL be properly cleaned up

### Requirement: Environment Variable Security
The system SHALL keep database credentials secure and out of version control.

#### Scenario: Local development setup
- **WHEN** a developer sets up the project locally
- **THEN** they SHALL use a `.env.local` file (gitignored)
- **AND** a `.env.local.example` template SHALL be provided

#### Scenario: Production deployment
- **WHEN** the application is deployed to production
- **THEN** environment variables SHALL be configured via the hosting platform
- **AND** no credentials SHALL be committed to git
