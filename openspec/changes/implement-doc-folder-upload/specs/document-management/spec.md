# Document Management Implementation Delta

This change implements existing requirements without modifying them. The requirements below are already defined in the base specification and are being completed with working code.

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Hierarchical Directory Structure
The system SHALL provide a hierarchical directory structure for organizing documents similar to a file manager interface.

**Implementation Status:** Completing server action and database integration for directory operations.

#### Scenario: Create root directory
- **WHEN** a user with appropriate permissions creates a new directory at the root level
- **THEN** the system SHALL create the directory with null parent_id
- **AND** the directory SHALL appear in the directory tree
- **AND** an audit log entry SHALL be created

#### Scenario: Create subdirectory
- **WHEN** a user creates a directory within an existing directory
- **THEN** the system SHALL create the directory with parent_id set to the parent directory
- **AND** the subdirectory SHALL appear nested under the parent in the tree view
- **AND** an audit log entry SHALL be created

### Requirement: Document Upload and Storage
The system SHALL support uploading documents to local filesystem storage with metadata tracked in the database.

**Implementation Status:** Completing upload API route and database integration for document creation.

#### Scenario: Upload new document
- **WHEN** a user uploads a document file
- **THEN** the system SHALL store the file in the configured DOCUMENT_STORAGE_PATH
- **AND** generate a SHA-256 hash for integrity verification
- **AND** create a document record with metadata in the database
- **AND** create a document version record with file reference
- **AND** set the user as the document owner
- **AND** set initial status to 'draft'
- **AND** create an audit log entry

#### Scenario: Upload with metadata
- **WHEN** a user uploads a document and provides metadata (title, category, review frequency)
- **THEN** the system SHALL validate all metadata fields
- **AND** store the metadata in the documents table
- **AND** calculate next_review_date based on effective_date and review_frequency_days

#### Scenario: File validation
- **WHEN** a user uploads a file
- **THEN** the system SHALL validate file size against configured limits
- **AND** validate file type is allowed
- **AND** reject uploads that fail validation with clear error messages
- **AND** display validation errors to the user
