# Document Management Module Proposal

## Why
Organizations need ISO 9001 and ISO 45001 compliant document management to maintain quality and safety standards. Current system lacks structured document control, version tracking, change management workflows, and compliance metrics required for certification audits.

## What Changes
- Add new document management safety module with file manager-style navigation
- Implement hierarchical directory structure for organizing documents
- Create document lifecycle management (new, pending approval, approved, under review, overdue)
- Build multi-stage approval workflow (author → reviewer → approver)
- Add change request system with commenting and approval routing
- Implement compliance metrics dashboard with drill-down capabilities
- Integrate with existing auth system while adding document-specific roles (owner, approver, reviewer)
- Support local filesystem storage with configurable path via environment variables
- Track document metadata: category, effective date, review frequency, responsible person
- Provide audit trail for all document changes

## Impact
- Affected specs: 
  - `document-management` (NEW) - Core document management capabilities
  - `data-access-layer` (MODIFIED) - Add document repositories
  - `module-registry` (no change) - Auto-discovery will handle new module
  - `dashboard-core` (no change) - Module will integrate via existing framework

- Affected code:
  - `lib/modules/document-management/` (NEW) - Module implementation
  - `lib/db/schema/documents.ts` (NEW) - Database schema for documents, directories, versions, change requests
  - `lib/db/repositories/documents.ts` (NEW) - Repository layer for document operations
  - `lib/auth/permissions.ts` (MODIFIED) - Add document-specific permission checks
  - `.env.local.example` (MODIFIED) - Add DOCUMENT_STORAGE_PATH configuration
  - `components/dashboard/` (possible new components) - Document viewer, file browser, metrics widgets

- Breaking changes: None
