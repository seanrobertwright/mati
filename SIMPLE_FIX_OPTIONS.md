# Simple Fix Options for Corporate Network Block

## Issue Summary
- ‚ùå Corporate network (Cisco Umbrella) blocks Supabase cloud
- ‚ùå Local Supabase needs Docker Desktop (not running)
- ‚úÖ You have database access via connection pooler

## üéØ RECOMMENDED: Use Database Only, Bypass Auth Temporarily

You already have **direct database access** via:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.vwwcprauksknefwslips:...@aws-1-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres
```

**This works because** the connection pooler (`pooler.supabase.com`) isn't being blocked!

### Quick Fix Steps:

**1. Bypass authentication temporarily**
**2. Use the direct database connection**
**3. Develop your features**
**4. Add auth later (or on different network)**

## Option A: Disable Auth Middleware (Fastest)

I can temporarily disable auth so you can:
- Access dashboard without login
- Test document management features
- Upload files and create folders
- Develop and test functionality

Then re-enable auth when on a different network.

## Option B: Mock Auth (Better for Testing)

Create a simple mock auth that:
- Always returns a test user
- Skips Supabase API calls
- Works offline
- Switch back to real auth later

## Option C: Use Mobile Hotspot

Connect to phone hotspot:
- Bypass corporate network
- Full Supabase Auth works
- No code changes needed

## Option D: Install Docker Desktop

1. Download: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
2. Install and start Docker
3. Run `supabase start`
4. Full local Supabase environment

## Which Would You Prefer?

**A** - Disable auth temporarily (quickest, test features now)
**B** - Mock auth with test user (better for realistic testing)
**C** - Use mobile hotspot when developing
**D** - Install Docker Desktop for full local setup

Let me know and I'll implement it!
