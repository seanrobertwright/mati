## 🔧 Viewer Role Fix Details

**Issue:** Test 3.6 initially failed because viewers saw empty dashboard

**Solution Implemented:** Option D (Hybrid Approach)

### Changes Made:
1. **Module Access** (lib/modules/*/index.ts)
   - Changed `minRole: 'employee'` → `minRole: 'viewer'`
   - Incident Reporting: Now accessible to viewers
   - Document Management: Now accessible to viewers

2. **Server-Side Security** (actions/*.ts)
   - Added permission checks: `if (!hasRole(user, 'employee')) return { error: 'Forbidden' }`
   - Protected 6 functions: createDocument, updateDocument, deleteDocument, createDirectory, renameDirectory, deleteDirectory
   - Viewers blocked at server level from making changes

3. **UI Read-Only Indicators** (DocumentRoute.tsx)
   - Added "Read-Only Access" badge for viewers
   - Hidden "New Folder" and "Upload Document" buttons for viewers
   - Clear visual feedback of read-only status

**Result:** 3-layer security with excellent UX

## 📝 Important Security Notes

### Global Logout Behavior
**What:** When a user logs out, ALL their sessions are terminated  
**Why:** Security best practice to prevent orphaned sessions  
**Expected:** This is correct Supabase behavior  
**Impact:** Multi-device users will be logged out everywhere

### Token Refresh
**What:** User roles are cached in JWT tokens  
**Why:** Performance and security  
**Expected:** Role changes require re-login to take effect  
**Impact:** Users must logout and login to see new permissions

### Self-Protection
**What:** Admins cannot modify their own role or delete their own account  
**Why:** Prevents accidentally losing admin access  
**Expected:** This is a safety feature  
**Impact:** Another admin must modify admin accounts
