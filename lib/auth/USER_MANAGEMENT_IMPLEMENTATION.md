# User Management Implementation

## Overview
Implemented full user management UI for admins using Supabase Admin SDK. Admins can now view all users, change roles, and delete users directly from the application.

## What Was Built

### 1. Admin Client Setup
**File:** `lib/auth/admin.ts`
- Created `createAdminClient()` function using Supabase Admin SDK
- Uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for elevated privileges
- Bypasses Row Level Security for admin operations
- Includes TypeScript interfaces for user data

### 2. Server Actions
**File:** `app/dashboard/admin/users/actions.ts`

#### `getAllUsers()`
- Fetches all users from Supabase Auth
- Requires admin privileges (checks current user role)
- Returns user data with email, role, creation date, last sign-in
- Handles errors gracefully

#### `updateUserRole(userId, newRole)`
- Updates user role in Supabase Auth metadata
- Prevents admins from changing their own role
- Validates role values
- Revalidates page cache

#### `deleteUser(userId)`
- Deletes user from Supabase Auth
- Prevents admins from deleting themselves
- Revalidates page cache

### 3. UI Components
**File:** `app/dashboard/admin/users/UserListTable.tsx`
- Client component for interactive user management
- Features:
  - User table with email, role, status, dates, actions
  - Role change dialog with all available roles
  - Delete confirmation dialog
  - Visual badges for roles and status
  - Prevents self-modification (can't change own role or delete self)
  - Loading states during operations
  - Success/error feedback via alerts

### 4. User Management Page
**File:** `app/dashboard/admin/users/page.tsx`
- Server component fetching users on load
- Displays user count in header
- Shows error message if Admin SDK not configured
- Includes role definitions card
- Protected route (admin only)

## Environment Setup

Added to `.env.local`:
```env
# Supabase Service Role Key (Admin API access)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZS1kZW1vIiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImV4cCI6MTk4MzgxMjk5Nn0.EGIM96RAZx35lJzdJsyH-qQwv8Hdp7fsn3W0YpN81IU
```

**Note:** This is the standard local Supabase demo key. In production, use your actual service role key from Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API.

## Security Considerations

### ✅ Implemented Safeguards
1. **Admin-only access**: All actions verify current user is admin
2. **Self-protection**: Admins cannot change their own role or delete themselves
3. **Server-side validation**: All operations happen on the server
4. **Role validation**: Only valid roles can be assigned
5. **Service key isolation**: Admin SDK only used in server components/actions

### ⚠️ Important Warnings
- **NEVER** expose `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to the client
- **ONLY** use Admin SDK in server-side code
- Admin SDK bypasses Row Level Security (RLS) - use with caution
- Consider audit logging for role changes in production

## Usage

### Accessing User Management
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/admin/users` (admin only)
2. View list of all users
3. Click "Change Role" to update a user's role
4. Click "Delete" to remove a user (with confirmation)

### Managing Roles
- **Admin**: Full system access
- **Manager**: Can view/edit all data
- **Employee**: Limited to own data
- **Viewer**: Read-only access

### Role Change Flow
1. Admin clicks "Change Role" button
2. Dialog shows current role and available roles
3. Admin clicks on desired role
4. Server validates and updates role in Supabase Auth
5. Page reloads with updated data

## Testing

### Manual Test Checklist
- [ ] Admin can access `/dashboard/admin/users`
- [ ] Non-admin users are redirected
- [ ] User list loads with all registered users
- [ ] Current user is marked with "You" badge
- [ ] Role badges display correctly
- [ ] Email verification status shows (Verified/Pending)
- [ ] "Change Role" button disabled for current user
- [ ] "Delete" button disabled for current user
- [ ] Role change dialog shows all 4 roles
- [ ] Selecting new role updates user and refreshes page
- [ ] Delete confirmation requires confirmation
- [ ] Deleting user removes from list
- [ ] Error messages display if service key missing

## Next Steps

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Task 7.1: Create admin-only user management route
- [x] Task 7.2: Implement user listing with Admin SDK
- [x] Task 7.3: Implement role assignment UI

### Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Task 7.4: Create user profile page (deferred)
- [ ] Task 7.5: First-user admin setup (already implemented via INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL)
- [ ] Tasks 8.1-8.5: Manual testing of auth flows
- [ ] Tasks 9.1-9.4: Documentation updates

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
- `lib/auth/admin.ts` - Admin SDK client setup
- `app/dashboard/admin/users/actions.ts` - Server actions for user management
- `app/dashboard/admin/users/UserListTable.tsx` - Interactive user table component

### Modified
- `app/dashboard/admin/users/page.tsx` - Replaced placeholder with working UI
- `.env.local` - Added SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

## Production Deployment Notes

1. **Service Role Key**: Replace the demo key in `.env.local` with your actual production key from Supabase Dashboard
2. **Email Confirmation**: Consider requiring email verification before role assignment
3. **Audit Logging**: Add audit trail for role changes and user deletions
4. **Rate Limiting**: Consider rate limiting on role change operations
5. **Notifications**: Email users when their role changes
6. **Backup**: Implement user export before deletion
