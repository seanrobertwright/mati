## üêõ Issues Found

### Issue 1: Directory Tree Collapsing on Click ‚úÖ FIXED
**Description:**
```
The directory tree was collapsing whenever a folder was clicked.
The expanded state was not being maintained across folder selections.
```
**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Expand a folder in the directory tree
2. Click on a different folder
3. Observe that the previously expanded folder collapses

**Expected:**
```
Expanded folders should remain expanded when navigating to other folders.
Only clicking the chevron should toggle expand/collapse.
```

**Actual:**
```
All folders collapsed whenever any folder was clicked.
```

**Severity:** ÔøΩ Medium

**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- Added state management for expanded directories in `DocumentRoute.tsx`
- Tree now maintains expanded state across all operations
- Auto-expands when selecting folders with children
- See `DIRECTORY_TREE_FIX.md` for details
