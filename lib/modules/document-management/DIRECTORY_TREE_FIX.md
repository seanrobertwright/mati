# Directory Tree State Management Fix

## Issue Reported
**Date:** October 15, 2025

**Problem:** The directory tree was collapsing whenever a folder was clicked. The expanded/collapsed state was not being maintained across selections.

**Root Cause:** The `DocumentRoute` component was not managing the expanded state for the `DirectoryTree`. When no `expandedIds` prop was passed, the `DirectoryTree` component used internal state that got reset on every re-render.

---

## Solution Implemented

### Changes Made to `DocumentRoute.tsx`

#### 1. Added Expanded State Management
```typescript
const [expandedDirectoryIds, setExpandedDirectoryIds] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
```

#### 2. Created Toggle Handler
```typescript
const handleToggleExpand = (directoryId: string) => {
  setExpandedDirectoryIds((prev) => {
    const next = new Set(prev);
    if (next.has(directoryId)) {
      next.delete(directoryId);
    } else {
      next.add(directoryId);
    }
    return next;
  });
};
```

#### 3. Enhanced Directory Selection
```typescript
const handleSelectDirectory = (directoryId: string | null) => {
  setCurrentDirectoryId(directoryId);
  
  // Auto-expand the selected directory if it has children
  if (directoryId) {
    const hasChildren = directories.some(d => d.parentId === directoryId);
    
    if (hasChildren) {
      setExpandedDirectoryIds((prev) => {
        const next = new Set(prev);
        next.add(directoryId);
        return next;
      });
    }
  }
};
```

#### 4. Wired Props to DirectoryTree
```typescript
<DirectoryTree
  directories={directories}
  selectedDirectoryId={currentDirectoryId}
  onSelectDirectory={handleSelectDirectory}  // ← Changed
  onDocumentDrop={handleDocumentDrop}
  expandedIds={expandedDirectoryIds}        // ← Added
  onToggleExpand={handleToggleExpand}       // ← Added
/>
```

## How It Works Now

### Behavior

1. **Expanding/Collapsing Folders**
   - Click the chevron (▶) to toggle expand/collapse
   - State is maintained in `expandedDirectoryIds` Set
   - Folder stays expanded when navigating to other folders

2. **Selecting a Folder**
   - Click anywhere on the folder name to select it
   - If the folder has children, it automatically expands
   - Previously expanded folders remain expanded
   - Selected folder is highlighted

3. **Persistent State**
   - Expanded state persists across:
     - Folder navigation
     - Document selection
     - Document drag-and-drop operations
     - Route changes within the module

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Fix ❌
- Click folder → tree collapses
- Navigate folders → tree resets
- Frustrating UX for nested folder structures
- Had to re-expand parent folders repeatedly

### After Fix ✅
- Click folder → tree stays expanded
- Navigate folders → tree state maintained
- Smooth navigation experience
- Parent folders remain visible
- Auto-expands when selecting folders with children

---

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Tests
- [x] Click a folder → it stays expanded
- [x] Expand multiple folders → all stay expanded
- [x] Collapse a folder → it collapses correctly
- [x] Select different folders → previously expanded ones stay expanded
- [x] Click chevron vs click folder name → both work correctly
- [x] Drag document between folders → tree state maintained
- [x] Navigate to different folders → no unexpected collapses

### Edge Cases
- [x] Empty folders (no children) → no chevron shown
- [x] Root level selection → tree state preserved
- [x] Rapid clicks → state updates correctly
- [x] Deep nesting → state maintained at all levels

## Technical Details

### State Management Pattern
- **Type:** React `useState` hook with `Set<string>`
- **Why Set?** Efficient lookups and uniqueness guarantee
- **Scope:** Component-level (persists during component lifecycle)
- **Reset:** Only on component unmount (navigation away from module)

### Performance
- O(1) lookup time for expanded state check
- Minimal re-renders (only affected tree nodes update)
- No performance impact on large directory trees

---

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements
1. **Persistent Across Sessions**
   - Store expanded state in localStorage
   - Restore on page load

2. **Expand All / Collapse All**
   - Add buttons to expand/collapse entire tree
   - Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+E, Ctrl+C)

3. **Smart Auto-Expand**
   - Auto-expand path to currently selected folder
   - Expand when document is moved to collapsed folder

4. **Animation**
   - Smooth expand/collapse transitions
   - Fade effects for better UX

### Modified
- `lib/modules/document-management/DocumentRoute.tsx`

### Unchanged (but related)
- `lib/modules/document-management/components/DirectoryTree.tsx`
  - Already had proper prop support
  - No changes needed

---

## Status
✅ **Fixed and Tested**
- Issue resolved
- Hot-reloaded and deployed to development
- Ready for user testing

---

## Notes
- This was the only issue found during initial testing
- All other drag-and-drop features working as expected
- Tree state management is now production-ready
