# ISO 9001:2015 Compliance Documentation

## Overview
This document demonstrates how the Document Management Module meets ISO 9001:2015 requirements for document control and quality management system documentation.

## ISO 9001:2015 Clause 7.5 - Documented Information

### 7.5.1 General
**Requirement:** The organization shall include documented information required by the standard and determined by the organization as necessary for the effectiveness of the quality management system.

**Implementation:**
- Flexible document categorization (policies, procedures, work instructions, forms, records)
- Hierarchical directory structure for organization-specific document organization
- Support for all document types required by quality management systems

**Evidence:**
- Document categories: `policy`, `procedure`, `work_instruction`, `form`, `record`
- Custom directory structure capability
- Metadata tracking for document classification

### 7.5.2 Creating and Updating
**Requirement:** When creating and updating documented information, the organization shall ensure appropriate:
- a) identification and description
- b) format and media
- c) review and approval for suitability and adequacy

**Implementation:**

#### a) Identification and Description
- **Unique document IDs** - Auto-generated UUID for each document
- **Version numbers** - Sequential version tracking
- **Titles and descriptions** - Required metadata fields
- **Categories** - Document classification system
- **Effective dates** - Track when documents become active
- **Creation and modification dates** - Automatic timestamp tracking

**Database Schema:**
```sql
documents (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  category_id UUID,
  effective_date TIMESTAMP,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP
)
```

#### b) Format and Media
- **Multiple file formats supported:**
  - Documents: PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint
  - Images: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP
  - Text files: TXT, CSV
- **File validation** - Type and size checking
- **Storage management** - Organized file system storage
- **Accessibility** - Web-based access from any location

**Supported MIME types:**
```typescript
ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES = {
  documents: ['application/pdf', 'application/msword', ...],
  images: ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', ...],
}
```

#### c) Review and Approval
- **Multi-stage approval workflow:**
  1. Draft → Author creates document
  2. Pending Review → Reviewer examines
  3. Pending Approval → Approver authorizes
  4. Approved → Document active
- **Approval records** - Who approved, when, and any notes
- **Rejection capability** - Send back to draft with reasons
- **Approval audit trail** - Complete history maintained

**State Machine:**
```
Draft ──> Pending Review ──> Pending Approval ──> Approved
  ↑          ↓                      ↓
  └──────────┴──────────────────────┘
           (Rejection path)
```

### 7.5.3 Control of Documented Information

#### 7.5.3.1 General
**Requirement:** Documented information shall be:
- a) available and suitable for use, where and when it is needed

**Search capabilities:**
```typescript
DocumentFilters {
  searchQuery: string;
  categories: string[];
  statuses: string[];
  ownerIds: string[];
  dateRange?: { from, to, field };
}
```

#### b) Protection
- **Access control:**

**Permission Schema:**
```sql
document_permissions (
  document_id UUID,
  user_id UUID,
  role VARCHAR(20) CHECK (role IN ('owner', 'approver', 'reviewer', 'viewer')),
  granted_by UUID,
  granted_at TIMESTAMP
)
```

#### 7.5.3.2 Specific Activities
**Requirement:** For control of documented information, the organization shall address the following activities, as applicable:
- a) distribution, access, retrieval and use
- b) storage and preservation, including preservation of legibility

```

#### b) Storage and Preservation
- **Storage:**
  - File system storage with configurable path

**Document states:**
```typescript
DocumentStatus = 
  | 'draft'           // Active work in progress
  | 'pending_review'  // Under review
  | 'pending_approval' // Awaiting approval
  | 'approved'        // Active and current
  | 'under_review'    // Periodic review
  | 'archived';       // Superseded but retained
```

## Additional ISO 9001 Compliance Features

### Periodic Review (Clause 7.5.2c)
**Requirement:** Documents shall be reviewed and approved for suitability and adequacy.

**Implementation:**
- **Review frequency** - Configurable per document (default: 90 days)
- **Review reminders** - Automatic notifications before due date
- **Review workflow:**
  1. System triggers review based on next_review_date
  2. Document owner notified
  3. Document status: approved → under_review
  4. Review completed
  5. Status: under_review → approved
  6. New next_review_date calculated

**Review scheduling:**
```sql
documents (
  review_frequency_days INTEGER,
  next_review_date TIMESTAMP,
  last_reviewed_at TIMESTAMP,
  reviewed_by UUID
)
```

### Document Obsolescence Prevention
**Implementation:**
- Overdue review dashboard widget

- Status indicator for overdue documents

### Unintended Use Prevention
**Implementation:**
