# Admin Role Issue - Fixed! ‚úÖ

## Problem
User couldn't access `/dashboard/admin/users` - was being redirected to `/dashboard`.

## Root Cause
Your user account didn't have the `admin` role in Supabase Auth metadata.

### Why This Happened
1. The signup process sets roles during account creation
2. Roles are assigned based on `NEXT_PUBLIC_INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL` environment variable
3. Your account was created before this was properly configured OR
4. The variable name mismatch: `.env.local` has `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL` but code expects `NEXT_PUBLIC_INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL`

## Solution Applied

### Step 1: Created Admin Role Script ‚úÖ
Created `scripts/set-admin-role.ts` to manually update user roles using Supabase Admin SDK.

### Step 2: Set Your Role to Admin ‚úÖ
Ran the script successfully:
```
üîç Looking for user: seanrobertwright@gmail.com
‚úì Found user: seanrobertwright@gmail.com (ID: 6498a760-88c1-4188-a283-266a99bfd6c3)
  Current role: none
‚úÖ Successfully set seanrobertwright@gmail.com as admin!
  New role: admin
```

### Step 3: Required - Log Out and Log Back In üîÑ
**YOU NEED TO DO THIS NOW:**

1. **Log out** of the application
   - Click your user menu in the top-right
   - Click "Logout"
   - OR go to: http://localhost:3001/login

2. **Log back in**
   - Email: `seanrobertwright@gmail.com`
   - Password: [your password]

3. **Try accessing admin page again**
   - Go to: http://localhost:3001/dashboard/admin/users
   - Should now work! ‚úÖ

## Why You Need to Log Out/In
Supabase Auth tokens cache the user's metadata. Logging out and back in will:
- Clear the old token (without admin role)
- Get a new token (with admin role)
- Allow access to admin pages

## Verification

After logging back in, check:
- [ ] Can access `/dashboard/admin/users` without redirect
- [ ] See user table with your account
- [ ] Your account has "Admin" badge
- [ ] "You" badge appears next to your email
- [ ] Action buttons are disabled for your account

## Additional Fix Applied

Added debug logging to the admin page to help diagnose future issues:
```typescript
console.log('üîç Admin page check:', {
  hasUser: !!user,
  userId: user?.id,
  email: user?.email,
  role: user?.app_metadata?.role,
  isAdmin: user ? isAdmin(user) : false,
});
```

Check browser console (F12) to see these logs.

## Environment Variable Fix (Optional)

To ensure future signups work correctly, you can update `.env.local`:

**Change:**
```env
INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL=seanrobertwright@gmail.com
```

**To:**
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL=seanrobertwright@gmail.com
```

This allows the signup form to see the variable and auto-assign admin role to that email.

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
- `scripts/set-admin-role.ts` - Script to manually set user roles

### Modified
- `app/dashboard/admin/users/page.tsx` - Added debug logging

## Next Steps

1. **NOW:** Log out and log back in
2. **THEN:** Try accessing `/dashboard/admin/users` again
3. **REPORT:** Does it work now? ‚úÖ / ‚ùå
