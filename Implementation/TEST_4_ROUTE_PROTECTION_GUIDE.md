   - What happens? redirect to login
   
3. **Try admin route:**
   - Type: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/admin/users`
   - What happens? redirect to login

4. **Try module route:**
   - Type: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/document-management`
   - What happens?

### **Expected:**
- ✅ All routes redirect to `/login`
- ✅ After login, should redirect back to requested page

1. **Try different URL patterns:**
   - `/dashboard`
   - `/dashboard/incident-reporting`
   - `/dashboard/document-management`
   - `/dashboard/admin/users`
   - `/dashboard/random-page` (doesn't exist)
