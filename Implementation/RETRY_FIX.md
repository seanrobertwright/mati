# Retry Fix: Disable Turbopack

## Issue
"Failed to fetch" error persisting with Turbopack enabled. This is a known compatibility issue with some packages in Next.js 15 + Turbopack.

## Fix Applied

**Changed `package.json` scripts:**
```json
"dev": "next dev"              // Now runs WITHOUT Turbopack (default)
"dev:turbo": "next dev --turbopack"  // Optional Turbopack mode
```

## Action Required

**Restart dev server WITHOUT Turbopack:**

```bash
# 1. Stop current server (Ctrl+C)

# 2. Clear Next.js cache
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next

# 3. Start server (now without Turbopack)
npm run dev

# 4. Hard refresh browser
# Press: Ctrl + Shift + R
```

## Why This Fixes It

Turbopack in Next.js 15 has known issues with:
- ✗ Some external packages (like @supabase/ssr)
- ✗ Fetch polyfills in certain environments
- ✗ Network request handling on Windows

Running without Turbopack uses the **stable webpack compiler** which has better compatibility.

## Performance Note

Without Turbopack:
- First compile will be slower (~30 seconds)
- But it's more stable and compatible
- Production builds are unaffected

## If You Want Turbopack Later

Once everything works, you can try Turbopack again:
```bash
npm run dev:turbo
```

But for now, stick with standard mode for stability.

## Expected Result

After restarting without Turbopack:
✅ Signup should work
✅ Login should work
✅ All Supabase operations should work
✅ Document upload/folder creation should work
