# Server Action Error - FIXED

## Error Details
```
Console UnrecognizedActionError
Server Action "008c83aa2dd8a7689b7477e4167f6ccdb0920a034d" was not found on the server.
Next.js version: 15.5.4 (Webpack)
```

## Root Cause
The `DocumentRoute.tsx` component was importing server actions directly from `'./actions/directories'` instead of using the centralized re-export from `'./actions'` (index file).

In **Next.js 15**, server actions must be properly re-exported through index files to maintain the action ID mapping that Next.js uses internally. Direct imports from action files can break this mapping.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Import Path
**File:** `lib/modules/document-management/DocumentRoute.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
import { createDirectory, getAllDirectories } from './actions/directories';
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { createDirectory, getAllDirectories } from './actions';
```

### 2. Added Type Safety
**File:** `lib/modules/document-management/actions/directories.ts`

- Added `type Directory` import from the repository
- Added explicit type casting to the returned directories array:
  ```typescript
  return { 
    success: true,
    directories: allDirectories as Directory[],
  };
  ```

### 3. Cleaned Up Unused Imports
Removed unused imports `getRootDirectories` and `getSubdirectories` that were causing linting warnings.

### 4. Fixed Unused Parameter Warnings
Prefixed intentionally unused parameters with underscore:
- `_force` in `deleteDirectory()`
- `_parentId` in `getDirectoryTree()`
- `_directoryId` and `_newParentId` in `moveDirectory()`

## Why This Matters

Next.js 15 uses a build-time action registry that maps action IDs to their implementations. When you:

1. **Import directly from action files**: The action might not be registered properly
2. **Import from index re-exports**: Next.js can track the action through the module graph correctly

The index file (`actions/index.ts`) serves as the **canonical source** for all server actions, ensuring they're properly bundled and registered.

## Files Modified

1. `lib/modules/document-management/DocumentRoute.tsx`
   - Changed import path from `'./actions/directories'` to `'./actions'`

2. `lib/modules/document-management/actions/directories.ts`
   - Added `type Directory` import
   - Added type casting to `getAllDirectories()` return value
   - Removed unused imports
   - Fixed unused parameter warnings

## Testing

After this fix:
1. ✅ Server actions should resolve correctly
2. ✅ Folder creation should work without "action not found" errors
3. ✅ Folders should appear in the UI immediately after creation
4. ✅ TypeScript errors should be resolved
5. ✅ No more console errors about unrecognized actions

## Related Fixes

This change works together with the previous fix for the folder UI display issue:
- **Previous fix**: Changed `getAllDirectories()` to return flat array instead of nested tree
- **This fix**: Ensured server actions are properly imported and registered

Both fixes are now in place for a fully working folder creation feature!
