# Re-Test 3.6: Viewer Access (After Fix)

## 🔧 Changes Applied

We've implemented **Option D (Hybrid Approach)** to fix the viewer role issue:

✅ **Phase 1:** Changed module minRole from 'employee' to 'viewer'  
✅ **Phase 2:** Added server-side permission checks to block viewer modifications  
✅ **Phase 3:** Added UI read-only indicators (badge + hidden buttons)

---

## 🧪 Quick Re-Test Instructions

### **In incognito window:**

1. **Logout and login as viewer:**
   - Email: `test-employee@example.com`
   - Password: `password123`
   - Should show "Viewer" in user menu

2. **Check Dashboard:**
   - ✅ Should see module cards (Incident Reporting, Document Management)
   - ✅ Dashboard should NOT be empty
   - ✅ Can click on modules

3. **Go to Document Management:**
   - Navigate to `/dashboard/document-management`
   - ✅ Page should load successfully

4. **Check Read-Only Indicators:**
   - ✅ Look for "Read-Only Access" badge near the title
   - ✅ NO "New Folder" button visible
   - ✅ NO "Upload Document" button visible
   - ✅ Can see directory tree (if any)
   - ✅ Can see document list (if any)

5. **Optional - Test Server Protection:**
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Try to create directory via console (should fail):
     ```javascript
     // This should return error
     await fetch('/api/documents/create-directory', {
       method: 'POST',
       body: JSON.stringify({ name: 'test' })
     })
     ```
   - Should get error: "Forbidden: Viewers have read-only access"
